# Github Action for Google Cloud Run branch deployments

Authenticate with gcloud, build and push image to GCR and deploy as a new revision or branch preview to Cloud Run.

## Usage

In your actions workflow, somewhere after the checkout step insert this:

```yaml

  with:
    # required
    project: [your-project-id]
    service_name: [your-service-name]
    key: ${{ secrets.GCP_CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE_KEY }}
    # optional
    registry: [eu.gcr.io]
    region: [europe-west1]
    working_directory: [.]
    check_if_changed: [false]
    env: []
